# Microservices
### What are Microservices
Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.

Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features.

### Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture
With monolithic architectures, all processes are tightly coupled and run as a single service. This means that if one process of the application experiences a spike in demand, the entire architecture must be scaled. Adding or improving a monolithic applicationâ€™s features becomes more complex as the code base grows. This complexity limits experimentation and makes it difficult to implement new ideas. Monolithic architectures add risk for application availability because many dependent and tightly coupled processes increase the impact of a single process failure.

With a microservices architecture, an application is built as independent components that run each application process as a service. These services communicate via a well-defined interface using lightweight APIs. Services are built for business capabilities and each service performs a single function. Because they are independently run, each service can be updated, deployed, and scaled to meet demand for specific functions of an application.

### What is docker
Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.

### Why Docker
![docker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115226294/203055961-50aec1c7-bc5a-4cc3-96ec-f0d6034d3ddb.jpeg)
- Docker allows you to ship code faster, standardize application operations, seamlessly move code, and save money by improving resource utilization.
- With Docker, you get a single that can reliably run anywhere.
- Docker's simple and straightforward syntax gives you full control.
- Wide adoption means there's a robust ecosystem of tools and off-the-shelf applications that are ready to use with Docker.

### How Docker works
When you try to run a container, Docker will first try to check your local machine for the image. If it is not there, it will fetch the appropriate image from the registry (docker hub) using an API.

### Docker commands
- Windows users should use `alias docker="winpty docker"` for the below commands to work.
- `docker run hello-world`: This first looks locally. Then it looks on the registry (on docker hub). It then displays the message if it finds it. The command is case sensitive.
- `docker images`: lists all the local images
- `docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx`: this will run the image, and the 80:80 is an example of port mapping, 80:3000 means image is from port 80, display in port 3000 in my machine. -d stands for detached - if there is an error, kill the container and run this command without -d to see the logs.
- `docker rm (id)`: Removes a container.
- `docker ps -a`: Lists all the running containers.
- 
- docker exec -it idhereok bash: The exec command is used to interact with already running containers on the Docker host. It allows you to start a session within the default directory of the container.
- docker stop containeridhere: Stops a running container(it does save changes).
- docker rm containeridhere -f: Completely removes a container.

## Create website task
1. In vscode create a file `index.html`
2. Then i pulled the latest docker image `docker pull nginx`
3. Then i started the image `docker run -dp 80:80 nginx`
4. i then copied over my index.html that was saved locally into my container - html folder `docker cp index.html 2359977b50d1:/usr/share/nginx/html/`
5. i ran my site and when i saw everything working i commited to docker hub `docker commit <container id> mosman7/eng130-website-profile:tagname`
6. Now we need to login to docker again `docker login`
7. Then we push to docker hub `docker push mosman7/eng130-website-profile:tagname`
